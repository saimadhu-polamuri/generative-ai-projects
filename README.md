# 🚀 Generative AI Projects

Welcome to **Generative AI Projects**, a dedicated space where I explore, experiment, and build projects around **Large Language Models (LLMs), AI Agents, Prompt Engineering, and more**. This repository serves as a **knowledge hub** and a collection of hands-on implementations, research insights, and practical use cases in Generative AI.

## 🔥 Why This Repository?
With the rapid evolution of AI, particularly in **Generative AI and LLMs**, staying updated requires continuous learning and experimentation. This repository is my **playground** to document:
- 📚 **Understanding LLMs** – Theory & Practical Implementations.
- 🤖 **Building AI Agents** – Automating workflows using LLM-based agents.
- 🏗️ **Hands-on Projects** – From prompt engineering to full-fledged AI applications.
- ⚙️ **Model Fine-Tuning** – Customizing models for specific tasks.
- 📝 **Exploring AI Frameworks** – LangChain, LlamaIndex, OpenAI API, Hugging Face, and more.
